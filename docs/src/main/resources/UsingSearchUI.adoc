The DDF Standard Search UI application allows a user to search for records in the local Catalog (provider) and federated sources. Results of the search are returned in HTML format and are displayed on a globe, providing a visual representation of where the records were found.

The right pane consists of a map. The Help page is accessed from the Search UI by clicking the help icon (image:help_icon.png[help]) in the menu bar then *Help Topics*.

== Search

The Standard Search UI allows users to search for records in the local Catalog and federated sources based on the criteria entered in the Search tab. After a search is executed, the UI provides results based on the defined criteria and detailed information about each result. Additionally, a user can save search criteria to a workspace, so the query can be executed again.

Located at the bottom of the left pane of the Search UI are two tabs: Search and Workspaces. The Search tab contains basic fields to query the Catalog and other sources. The workspaces feature uses the same search criteria that are provided in the Search tab, and it also allows the user to create custom searches that can be saved for later execution. The right-side pane displays a map that, when records are found, shows the location of where the record was retrieved.

Navigate to `http://localhost:8181/search` to open the Standard Search UI.

=== Search Criteria
The Search UI queries a Catalog using the following configurable criteria.

=== Save a Search

Saved searches are search criteria that are created and saved by a user. Each saved search has a name that was defined by the user, and the search can be executed at a later time or be scheduled for execution. Saved records (metacards) that the user elected to save for future use are returned as part of a search. These queries can be saved to a workspace, which is a  collection of searches and metacards created by a user.

Complete the following procedure to create a saved search.

. Select the Search tab at the bottom of the left pane.
. Use the fields provided to define the search criteria for the query to be saved.

[.left]
image::save_a_search.png[Save Search]

[TIP]
====
Example

Query parameters are highly configurable. An example scenario could be monitoring activity in a certain country, such as Luxembourg. Location-based search could be as simple as a bounding box around the desired area. The polygon search allows fine-tuning along geographic features or national borders. A second, contextual query can field results mentioning the subject country originating outside the borders.

Grouping similar searches into workspaces simplifies workflow and automates those queries that need to run repeatedly or frequently.
image::map_area.png[Map Area]

====

. Select the *Save* button. The Select Workspace pane opens.
. Type a name for the query in the *ENTER NAME FOR SEARCH* field.
. Select a workspace in which to save the query, or create a workspace by typing a title for the new workspace in the *New Workspace* field.

image::select_workspace.png[Select Workspace]
. Select the Save button. 

.Download Link and Product Size
[WARNING]
====
The size of the product is based on the value in the associated metacard's resource-size attribute. This is defined when the metacard was originally created and may or may not be accurate. Often it will be set to Unknown Size, indicating that the size is unknown or not applicable.

However, if the administrator has enabled caching on DDF and has installed the `catalog-core-resourcesizeplugin` PostQuery Plugin, and if the product has been retrieved, it has been cached and the size of the product can be determined based on the cached file's size. Therefore, subsequent query results that include that product will display an accurate size under the download link.
====

=== Workspaces

Each user can create multiple workspaces and assign each of them a descriptive name. Each workspace can contain multiple saved searches and have multiple saved records (metacards). Workspaces are saved for each user and are loaded when the user logs in. Workspaces and their contents are persisted, so they survive if DDF is restarted. Currently, workspaces are private and cannot be viewed by other users. 

==== Create a Workspace

. Select the Workspaces tab at the bottom of the Search UI's left pane. The Workspaces pane opens, which displays the existing Workspaces that were created by the user. At the top of the pane, an option to *Add* and an option to *Edit* are displayed.
. Select the *Add* button at the top of the left pane. A new workspace is created.
. In the *Workspace Name* field, enter a descriptive name for the workspace.

image::add_workspace.png[Add Workspace]

. Select the *Add* button. The Workspaces pane opens, which now displays the new workspace and any existing workspaces.
. Select the name of the new workspace. The data (i.e., saved searches and records) for the selected workspace is displayed in the Workspace pane.
. Select the *+* icon near the top of the pane to begin adding queries to the workspace. The Add/Edit Search pane opens.
. Enter a name for the new query to be saved in the *QUERY NAME* field.
. Complete the rest of the search criteriaad.

image::add_edit_search.png[Add/Edit Search]

. Select the *Save & Search* button. The Search UI begins searching for records matching the criteria, and the new query is saved to the workspace. When the search is complete, the Workspace pane opens.
. Select the name of the search to view the query results.

image::named_search.png[Name of Search]

. If necessary, in the Workspace pane, select the *Edit* button then select the pencil icon (image:pencil_icon.png[Edit]) next to the name of a query to change the search criteria. 

. If necessary, in the Workspace pane, select the delete icon (image:delete_icon.png[]) next to the name of a query to delete the query from the workspace.

=== Notifications and Activities

==== Notifications

The Standard Search UI receives all notifications from DDF.  These notifications appear as pop-up windows inside the Search UI to alert the user of an event of interest. To view all notifications, select the notification icon (image:notification_icon.png[Notification]).

Currently, the notifications provide information about product retrieval only.  After a user initiates a resource download, they receive periodic notifications that provide the progress of the download (e.g., the download completed, failed, or is being retried).
Refer to the Configuring Notifications and the Asynchronous Notifications and Activities sections of the DDF documentation for more detailed information.    

[WARNING]
====
A notification popup will remain visible until it is dismissed or the browser is refreshed. Once a notification is dismissed, it cannot be retrieved again.
====

==== Activities

Similar to notifications, activities appear as pop-up windows inside the Search UI. Activity events include the status and progress of actions that are being performed by the user, such as searches and downloads. To view all activities, select the activity icon (image:activity_icon.png[Activity Icon]) in the top-right corner of the window. A list of all activities opens in a drop-down menu, from which activities can be read and deleted. If a download activity is being performed, the Activity drop-down menu provides the link to retrieve the product. Refer to the example of the Activity menu below.

If caching is enabled, a progress bar is displayed in the Activity (Product Retrieval) drop-down menu until the action being performed is complete. Refer to the Asynchronous Notifications and Activities section of the DDF documentation for more information.

== Downloads

Downloads from the UI are currently managed by the user-specific browser's download manager, and will also be displayed as notifications when cancelled or completed.

== Uploading New Resources
In order to ingest new resources to the 3d_iconlocal DDF repository, the user can select the upload icon (image:upload_icon.png[Upload]) in the top right corner of the window to launch the Upload dialog.  This dialog allows you to upload a resource and input metacard attributes about this resource.

. Select the file to upload by browsing or by drag and drop.

image:upload.png[Upload]

. Click Start Upload to upload the resource.

image:start_upload.png[Start Upload]

. Update metacard attributes and Save the metacard.

image:update_attributes.png[Update Attributes]

. Select OK.  The resource will be stored and the metacard will be generated.  The contents of the resource will be used to generate the metadata if the format of the resource is recognized.

== Maps

The right side of the Search UI contains a map to locate search results on. There are three views for this map, 3D, 2D, and Columbus View. To

choose a different view, select the map icon in the upper right corner. (The icon will change depending on current view selected: 3D - image:3d_icon.png[3d], 2D - image:2d_icon.png[2d], Columbus image:columbus_icon.png[Columbus].)

3D View

The 3D view is a fully interactive globe view.

image:3d_view.png[3D View]

2D View

The 2D view is a flattened map view. It is preferable in environments that do not support the more resource-intensive globe view. 

image::2d_view.png[2D View]

Columbus View

This View is another alternative format for viewing search results' locations.

image::columbus_view.png[Columbus View]

== Known Issues
Stale search results, i.e., records that have been deleted, may be displayed in query search results sometimes. This occurs when the query cache has not been kept in sync with the catalog provider as records were deleted from the provider. If this occurs, the administrator should be notified to clean the query cache following the instructions for Troubleshooting DDF Standard Search UI.
