The DDF source code was posted to GitHub today and can be downloaded at https://github.com/codice/ddf

Licensed under LGPL, DDF is an interoperability platform that provides secure and scalable discovery and retrieval from a wide array of disparate sources. DDF is built to "unzip and run" while having the ability to scale to large enterprise systems.
 It is the core software component of the DCGS Integration Backbone (DIB) used by many government entities to expose and share data and services between systems. It was with the support of the OSD that we were able to make this a reality and we have
  been fortunate to gain their assistance in moving it through the export control and public release process.

Lockheed Martin has donated all copyright to the Codice Foundation, a non-profit established to provide infrastructure, support, education, and export control advice to  government-focused teams desiring to operate open source projects.
 The tools used by the DDF team are being provided by Codice (pronounced 'c≈ç-diss'). If you are contemplating a move into the open, I recommend, and support, your contacting Codice at in...@codice.org or by visiting the website at
  http://www.codice.org.

The Lockheed team will continue to develop DDF but will now do so in the open and with any luck, with the support of a larger community. We are just getting started and this is in fact considered a "soft launch" as we will be
 migrating documentation to the Codice wiki at https://tools.codice.org/wiki/display/DDF/Distributed+Data+Framework+Home .  Issue tracking has already begun with the DDF scrum master, creating the first JIRA ticket (DDF-1)
  in the open today at https://tools.codice.org/jira/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=11&view=planning . There is a new Google group called ddf-codice that I encourage anyone interested to join.

Please feel free to start poking around and provide feedback. While it has been an effort to get to this point, I am certain the work has only just begun.
 That said, myself and the entire team look forward to working with a broader group and helping to meet needs we have yet to contemplate. 
 We're all excited to expose work accomplished behind closed doors and are anxious for the possibilities that await in the open source world.
